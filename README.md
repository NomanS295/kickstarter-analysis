# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview and Purpose of Project

1. Help the client named Louise with her data and import data into tables for analysis  
2. Create Pivot tables and pivot charts
3.	Excercise Excel prowess
4. Visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals 
5. Use multiple kinds of excel functions such as COUNTIFS() , SUM() , YEAR()
6. Interpret common Excel visualizations. 
7. Create two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.
 
 ## Analysis and Challenges
 
#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 Louise was interested in the theater data so in the picture below the data is filtered by that catagory. The number of live outcomes were filtered out and the only catagories that were counted were the successful failed and cancelled ones.

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 The live outcomes were filtered again due to it being a very small number. Louise's main focus is to get information about the plays subcategory so the graph is filtered and shows only the plays subcategory. All the number of outcomes are in percentages.

## Results
### Conclusions drawn from the graph of the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
 The conclusions that can be drawn from the first graph(Outcomes Based on Launch Date) are that the best months for the theater project are May and June and people start losing interest through the end of the year. another conclusion that can be drawn is that there are not many cancelled shows throughout the year.
### Conclusions that can be drawn from the Outcomes Based on Goals
  There are multiple conclusions that can be drawn from the Outcomes Based on Goals. One of the main conclusions that could be taken away from this graph is that none of the shows were cancelled and they were all either successful or failed. Another conclusion that we could take from this graph is that the best percentage of outcomes are projects that have goals that are less than $5000 or are between $35000 and $45000
  ## Challenges faced 
  There were not many challenges that were made during this analysis except one where there was trouble making the table for the analysis of outcomes based on goals. The "COUNTIF()" function was difficult to use but aside from this issue there were no other challenges that were faced in the making of this analysis.
  

## Dataset limitations 

 The data limitation in the first graph is that the cancelled outcomes are filtered out due to it being a small number. The only two outcomes that were counted were the successful, live and failed ones. 
 
 ## Other tables and graphs that could be created
 There could be a new table that could count the number of months and days between the launch and deadline dates along with the amount of outcomes and be turned into a line graph. Another table/graph that could be created is a pivot table for the outcomes based on goal graph. A Pivot table for this graph would give more options to filter from and let us understand the data more thoroughly and help us make a line graph with more data to choose from.
